        "biography": "An acerbic satirical assessment of asinine assumptions about scarce assets, assiduously and synchronistically assigning asymmetric value assessments of associative analogues to antideleuvian advances in anti-censorship. Sometimes anthropomorphic. Bitcoin satire pioneer. Aloof canon with a heart of gold 2.0. Investor in deflationary egos / assets. Advisor to zero ICOs. Blog√ºscape influencer. Heuristic hedonist. Hockey hocker. Air-dropping knowledge in the greater-bitcoin area once a week."

        "biography": "Marisol Vengas is an anonymous-shrouded-in-secrecy artist collective originating from Northern California. She seems to operate in a AI-induced hive mindset. Some of her works are produced from over a dozen or plus artists who have never met in real life. Some of them have discovered each other from forums and online groups, and none of the know how they've been to selected to participate in the collective. The artists don't know who they get the pieces from or where they end up. No one really knows who started Marisol, but they do know she's going to running for a long time. She's a truly a decentralized living artist. Currently she has exhibited over 10 countries and has produced thousands of works. You can find these work from the streets of Bangladesh to the museums of Paris. Clues about her existence are littered throughout her work."
